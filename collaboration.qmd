title: "Collaboration"

The heart of this research effort, as with all scientific pursuits, is the advancement of our collective understanding of the world. Perhaps more than our usual research efforts, though, this project is inspired by and hinges on the integration of research and ideas across research communities. Collaboration is thus a central focus of our work.

The project will hold a series of meetings of comparative law scholars and taxonomists to foster conceptual integration. The meetings will likely be hybrid meetings, with in-person and virtual participation options, as well as the possibility of pre- and post-meeting sessions online. We hope to recruit participants from diverse regions and fields, drawing people who produce or classify data in many areas of comparative law. These meetings will allow participants to present datasets and accompanying ontologies, discuss best practices related to ontologies, build working relationships, and collaborate on conceptual integration. The meetings will also serve as a way to vet initial inputs into our planned ontology repository.
