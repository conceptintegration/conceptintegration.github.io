title: "Ontology Enrichment"

A central focus of our prior work has been the collection and analysis of contemporary and historical constitutions, which we have organized as the Comparative Constitutions Project (CCP) (Elkins and Ginsburg 2021). Using the CCP ontology, we have identified a core set of 330 topics in each written constitution of independent countries from 1789 to the present. This spatial-temporal identification of constitutional elements has since facilitated at least 200 published analyses of the origins and consequences of these institutions. Yet, we do not see CCP as the authoritative ontology in this space. If anything, we see CCP as a preliminary reference set for the integration of other ontologies in comparative law.

Our ontology enrichment project thus refines the CCP ontology to expand its conceptual scope and to optimize the ontology for use with NLP tools. Ontologies that express topics in ways that rely on analystsâ€™ implicit knowledge are not best suited for use with NLP tools. For one thing, the definitions of two distinct concepts in an ontology may include similar words if they relate to the same context, leaving concepts insufficiently disambiguated and unable to retrieve distinct passages in a corpus. Topic refinement is thus needed to increase the resolution of topics, rewording them to increase the semantic distance between topics and reduce the number of common sentences they match. Ontology enrichment is also needed to expand the conceptual scope of our ontology to capture evolving constitutional content and diverse conceptualizations in the constitutional domain.

Our approach takes several steps to refine the CCP ontology for use with our NLP tools and to increase its topical scope. This will:

* Rewrite CCP topics to improve differentiation between topics, discrimination in topic matches, and accuracy of topic matches.
* Examine global, regional, and domain-specific ontologies to identify topics that are not yet in the CCP ontology but are relevant to corpus CCP classifies (constitutions).
* Publish a new CCP ontology that integrates the topic refinements for NLP applications, concepts enriched by similar concepts in other ontologies, and relevant new concepts integrated from other ontologies.

Refinement of the CCP ontology is a requisite step for our follow-on projects. Yet, it also allows us to answer several research questions related to ontology enrichment, namely: Which topic structures are most compatible with our NLP tools? How can we measure improved CCP topic separation and topic matching? How can ontology comparison improve ontology accuracy, completeness, and alignment across a domain?
