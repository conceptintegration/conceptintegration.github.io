    "text": "A central focus of our prior work has been the collection and analysis of contemporary and historical constitutions, which we have organized as the Comparative Constitutions Project (CCP) (Elkins and Ginsburg 2021). Using the CCP ontology, we have identified a core set of 330 topics in each written constitution of independent countries from 1789 to the present. This spatial-temporal identification of constitutional elements has since facilitated at least 200 published analyses of the origins and consequences of these institutions. Yet, we do not see CCP as the authoritative ontology in this space. If anything, we see CCP as a preliminary reference set for the integration of other ontologies in comparative law.\nOur ontology enrichment project thus refines the CCP ontology to expand its conceptual scope and to optimize the ontology for use with NLP tools. Ontologies that express topics in ways that rely on analysts’ implicit knowledge are not best suited for use with NLP tools. For one thing, the definitions of two distinct concepts in an ontology may include similar words if they relate to the same context, leaving concepts insufficiently disambiguated and unable to retrieve distinct passages in a corpus. Topic refinement is thus needed to increase the resolution of topics, rewording them to increase the semantic distance between topics and reduce the number of common sentences they match. Ontology enrichment is also needed to expand the conceptual scope of our ontology to capture evolving constitutional content and diverse conceptualizations in the constitutional domain.\nOur approach takes several steps to refine the CCP ontology for use with our NLP tools and to increase its topical scope. This will:\nRefinement of the CCP ontology is a requisite step for our follow-on projects. Yet, it also allows us to answer several research questions related to ontology enrichment, namely: Which topic structures are most compatible with our NLP tools? How can we measure improved CCP topic separation and topic matching? How can ontology comparison improve ontology accuracy, completeness, and alignment across a domain?"

    "text": "Papers\nExpanding Your Vocabulary: Topic Integration Combining Automation and Human Expertise\nTopic discovery and integration are essential to keep vocabularies—the set of concepts underlying a textual corpus—relevant. New topics come from a number of sources, including recent additions to a corpus, reconceptualizations of a domain, or concepts from other domains. We present a methodology that combines automation and human expertise to assess candidate topics. To develop the methodology we used a vocabulary created by the Comparative Constitutions Project (CCP) that tracks more than 330 topics within a corpus of national constitutions. The methodology enables users to formulate candidate topics that comprise grammatically well-formed labels and descriptions. A sentence-level semantic similarity model is used to search for constitution sections that are similar in meaning to a topic, provided the topic is not similar in meaning to any existing topic. Search results are output as a CSV file in which users identify the constitution sections that best match the meaning of the topic. Domain experts collaborate on the design of topics by iteratively refining the topic formulation until it captures all applicable sections. A panel of scholars then decides whether to accept topics into the CCP vocabulary, after which matching constitution sections are automatically tagged with accepted topics. Using our methodology, several new topics have been added to the CCP vocabulary, some of which we use here to illustrate our process and results. The methodology provides researchers with a systematic way to expand existing vocabularies.\nAligning Social Science Ontologies via Multipartite Graphs and Text Embeddings\nWe propose a methodology to align social science ontologies, which are often loosely connected yet not fully cross-compatible. In our framework, multiple ontologies are represented via one multipartite graph, where vertices are topics and edges measure the semantic similarity between topics from different ontologies. This abstraction allows us to make the problem of alignment tractable by generating graph-level statistics and visualizations. In an illustration, we align two ontologies for topics in constitutions and peace agreements. Our methodology allows us to identify where existing ontologies align or differ, as well as to assess how potential new topics might fit in them. Future steps include public-facing interactive tools and direct connections with in-ontology and out-of-ontology text corpora."

Nearly 80% of countries today explicitly grant one or more courts the power to interpret the constitution (Elkins and Ginsburg 2022), positioning courts to shape broad swaths of the political and social realm (Stone Sweet 2000; Hirschl 2004). Yet cross-national assessment of such court elaboration has been relatively narrow. Studies of court rulings typically focus on one country over time or on a finite set of topics in several countries. Such studies have been key to understanding the legal dynamics of that country or issue set, but they do not reveal all of the constitutional issues people bring to courts around the world. To date, it has been prohibitively complex to assess the litigation of all constitutional topics in a large set of countries.\nThis paper presents a new approach to assessing the constitutional content of court rulings, identifying the constitutional ideas that are most litigated in courts globally. To do so, we use the Comparative Constitutions Project (CCP) vocabulary that tracks more than 330 topics in national constitutions (Elkins and Ginsburg 2022). We use new multi-lingual, semantic similarity tools to apply these topics to an extensive collection of national court rulings compiled by the European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission n.d.). This dataset includes nearly 15,000 court rulings from 120 countries in Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Europe since 1803, allowing us to identify the most litigated constitutional topics in a much broader set of courts than has been compared previously. This methodology allows us to trace constitutional content through court rulings over time and across diverse regions of the world, exploring which constitutional topics are and are not litigated in courts and how this varies across countries and legal regimes."

Yet it is hard to analyze these questions across different countries and contexts without a coordinated approach to conceptualizing and identifying these ideas. CCP’s current analysis of 330 features across constitutions is a robust start at systematic analysis of national constitutions, yet an expanded set of topics and tools will allow us to identify myriad additional topics. Human-based content analysis is time-consuming, costly, and (even with rigorous coding procedures) inherently subjective. On the other hand, our NLP tools support automated content analysis that is more comprehensive, objective, and reproducible.\nOur constitutional project thus uses our new CCP ontology to conduct an expanded analysis of constitutions. The aim is to produce complete section-level topic coverage of national constitutions worldwide. This will identify topics in constitution sections that are not yet indexed by CCP and will identify even more topics in those sections already indexed by CCP.\nOur approach takes several steps to identify a comprehensive set of topics in national constitutions worldwide.

    "text": "Concepts are at the core of scientific inquiry. In some fields, systematizing and organizing concepts has been a central concern, and has even led to high levels of consensus on categories and labels. The Linnaean taxonomy in biology and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in Psychiatry are two well-known examples. In other fields, such as law and political science, concepts are less regulated.\nUncoordinated proliferation of conceptual frameworks in comparative law constrains systematic comparison and alignment of findings across studies, and in turn constrains the accumulation of knowledge. Fifty years ago, Giovanni Sartori and others—concerned about just such a “Tower of Babel” problem in political science—spearheaded a movement towards a more self-conscious use of concepts. Like Sartori, we recognize the personal and collective benefits of analyzing concepts and associating them with empirical phenomena. We also perceive an opportunity to use technology to advance this work.\nNatural language processing (NLP) can accelerate a more systematic approach to the representation of concepts in comparative law. We are developing concept-processing tools that measure the semantic similarity of sentence-level text segments, with no preprocessing of text. These allow us to analyze the large volumes of text generated from legal processes like constitutional design, public consultation, and court rulings—all critically important processes with products that have historically been too unwieldy to analyze in a broadly comparative way.\nOur digital tools facilitate the systematic comparison, integration, and application of concepts across comparative law. We seek to use them to improve constitutional design by organizing and enriching the historical and cross-national information available to constitution drafters and analysts. But they are applicable across the constitutional domain and beyond.\nFunding acknowledgment: This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Number 2315189.

And yet, there is little comparative, empirical research tracing the development of this vision across an entire constitution-making process. Three recent constitutional reform efforts in Chile offer an unparalleled opportunity to examine the impacts of varied approaches to public consultation and constitution drafting on the expression and uptake of constitutional ideas. Prior analysis of these consultations (Fierro et al. 2017; Ureta et al. 2021; Raveau et al. 2022) and drafting processes (Escudero 2021; Piscopo and Siavelis 2021) has been notable but limited, due in part to the challenges of analyzing voluminous textual data produced by such legal processes. Natural language processing offers a systematic approach to analyzing the topics raised in such legal processes, allowing us to trace the uptake and evolution of constitutional ideas across Chile’s historic constituent process.\nUsing a comprehensive set of constitutional topics and new concept processing tools, this paper compares topics raised in public consultations, drafting deliberations, and constitution drafts in Chile’s constituent process over the last decade. To do so, we compile qualitative public input, transcribe drafting body deliberations, and process constitution drafts from all three recent drafting processes in Chile: the process conducted by then-President Michelle Bachelet from 2016-17, the Constitutional Convention process from 2021-22, and the Expert Commission and Constitutional Council process conducted in 2023. We assess which topics were of most interest to Chileans in each phase, whether drafters leveraged public input rhetorically or substantively, and whether the design of consultations and drafting bodies shaped the resulting constitutional texts. This informs our understanding of the Chilean process and gleans lessons for constitution making more broadly."

    "text": "Research Products\nOur methods translate to a series of research products we use in our own work but also intend to be useful to other researchers working in the legal domain. These include: (1) an expanded CCP ontology, optimized for use with NLP tools and expanded to provide broader topic coverage, (2) comprehensive constitutional analysis of topics raised in national constitutions worldwide, (3) new methods for consultation analysis to discover and trace ideas raised in public input during consultations on constitutional issues, (4) new methods for conducting systematic court ruling analysis, revealing which constitutional ideas gain traction and how they evolve after a constitution’s adoption, (5) a public ontology repository where scholars can share, explore, and integrate concepts across the field of comparative law, and (6) interactive tools to explore ontologies and corpora using our methodology."

    "text": "Research Contributions\nWe aim to make several methodological, ontological, and substantive contributions to the field of comparative law. On the methodological side, we are developing multilingual concept processing tools that compare and integrate concepts and ontologies in comparative law. On the ontological side, we are developing a replicable process for optimizing the performance of ontologies in semantic-similarity applications, refining and expanding our CCP ontology, and creating a public repository for ontologies in comparative law. On the substantive side, we are identifying geographic and temporal patterns in the constitutional ideas entrenched in constitutions, raised by citizens, and litigated in courts."
