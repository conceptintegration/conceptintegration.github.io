Specifically, we use version 4 of Google’s Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) model and version 3 of the multilingual USE model to support our work in ontology enrichment and concept integration. Over the last 10 years, we have experimented with other NLP methods, but in our view, vector semantics shows the most promise.\nWe are using these tools to: (1) refine the Comparative Constitutions Project (CCP) ontology for use with NLP tools and integrate multiple conceptual frameworks from comparative law to provide broader topic coverage, (2) use the new CCP ontology to provide section-level topic coverage of national constitutions globally, (3) link constitutional content to public consultation input to assess the prevalence, evolution, and uptake of constitutional ideas raised by citizens, and (4) link constitutional content to court rulings to assess the prevalence, evolution, and extension of constitutional ideas brought to courts around the world."

Perhaps more than our usual research efforts, though, this project is inspired by and hinges on the integration of research and ideas across research communities. Collaboration is thus a central focus of our work.\nThe project will hold a series of meetings of comparative law scholars and taxonomists to foster conceptual integration. The meetings will likely be hybrid meetings, with in-person and virtual participation options, as well as the possibility of pre- and post-meeting sessions online. We hope to recruit participants from diverse regions and fields, drawing people who produce or classify data in many areas of comparative law. These meetings will allow participants to present datasets and accompanying ontologies, discuss best practices related to ontologies, build working relationships, and collaborate on conceptual integration. The meetings will also serve as a way to vet initial inputs into our planned ontology repository."

    "text": "Constitution drafters and researchers have long explored the origins and consequences of constitutional ideas—to learn why constitutions succeed and falter, when constitutional ideas gain traction, and how they shape people’s lives. Yet it is hard to analyze these questions across different countries and contexts without a coordinated approach to conceptualizing and identifying these ideas. CCP’s current analysis of 330 features across constitutions is a robust start at systematic analysis of national constitutions, yet an expanded set of topics and tools will allow us to identify myriad additional topics. Human-based content analysis is time-consuming, costly, and (even with rigorous coding procedures) inherently subjective. On the other hand, our NLP tools support automated content analysis that is more comprehensive, objective, and reproducible.\nOur constitutional project thus uses our new CCP ontology to conduct an expanded analysis of constitutions. The aim is to produce complete section-level topic coverage of national constitutions worldwide. This will identify topics in constitution sections that are not yet indexed by CCP and will identify even more topics in those sections already indexed by CCP.\nOur approach takes several steps to identify a comprehensive set of features in current constitutions. This will:\n\nUse the new CCP ontology to automatically classify the topic of each section of all national constitutions currently in force around the world.\nApply new and revised topic assignments to all current constitutions.\nPublish the new constitutional data on GitHub and on Constitute.\n\nThis allows us to answer several research questions related to constitutional analysis, including: What new topics and patterns are revealed in analyzing the full topical scope of the world’s constitutions? How can we measure improvements in new topic discovery in constitutions? How can we validate the reduction of constitutional content without a CCP topic and the accuracy of topic matching to constitutions?"

    "text": "Studies on judicial rulings focus largely on one country over time or on a finite set of topics in several countries. Such studies have been key to understanding the legal dynamics of that country or issue set, but they don’t compare all of the issues people bring to courts across many countries. To date, it has been prohibitively complex to study court elaboration of the all constitutional topics in a large set of countries.\nOur court project has developed tools to link constitutional content to court rulings to assess court elaboration of the full suite of constitutional topics. We are using these to identify the constitutional topics raised in court rulings in over 100 countries. Our approach takes several steps to:\n\nUse our CCP ontology to automatically classify the topics raised in court rulings in over 100 countries.\nTrace the prevalence, evolution, and extension of constitutional ideas raised in court rulings within and across these countries.\nCompare the prevalence of topics raised in court cases to those entrenched in the world’s constitutions.\n\nThis allows us to answer several research questions related to court rulings: Which constitutional ideas are (and are not) brought before the courts? How does this vary across countries and legal systems? How does the understanding of these constitutional ideas evolve after judicial review? In Chile, were constitutional reform priorities raised by citizens also litigated in courts or only shared in consultation fora? How can we validate the accuracy of topic matching to court rulings?"

    "text": "Public consultation has become an indispensable part of constitutional design, yet the voluminous narrative data produced are notoriously difficult to analyze. Most recently, the consultation process in Chile produced more than 2.4 million suggestions for constitutional content and nearly 265,000 more comments explaining these. The question guiding such consultations—“Which constitutional topics are of most interest to citizens?”—is intractable without an applicable ontology and a method for analyzing vast volumes of text.\nOur consultation project has developed tools to link constitutional content to public consultation input to assess the prevalence, evolution, and uptake of constitutional ideas raised by citizens. We are currently analyzing the world’s most recent and ambitious consultation effort in Chile. Detailed, systematic analysis of such voluminous public consultation input has been prohibitively complex to date, but our new tools make it possible.\nOur approach takes several steps to assess the constitutional topics raised in Chilean public consultations. This will:\n\nUse our CCP ontology to automatically classify the topics raised in public consultation input.\nTrace the prevalence, evolution, and uptake of citizens’ constitutional ideas across the Chilean constitutional reform process, including public consultations held before and during the constitutional drafting, deliberations in the drafting body, and the final constitutional text.\nCompare the prevalence of topics raised in Chilean public consultations to topics entrenched in the world’s constitutions.\n\nThis allows us to answer several research questions related to public consultations, namely: Which constitutional topics are raised most often in Chilean public consultations and drafting body deliberations? How do topics raised in Chile compare to those in constitutions globally? Do drafters leverage public input rhetorically or substantively in the drafting process? How does the design and timing of consultations shape constitutional text? How can we validate the accuracy of topic matching to consultation corpora?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "A central focus of our prior work has been the collection and analysis of contemporary and historical constitutions, which we have organized as the Comparative Constitutions Project (CCP) (Elkins and Ginsburg 2021). Using the CCP ontology, we have identified a core set of 330 topics in each written constitution of independent countries from 1789 to the present. This spatial-temporal identification of constitutional elements has since facilitated at least 200 published analyses of the origins and consequences of these institutions. Yet, we do not see CCP as the authoritative ontology in this space. If anything, we see CCP as a preliminary reference set for the integration of other ontologies in comparative law.\nOur ontology enrichment project thus refines the CCP ontology to expand its conceptual scope and to optimize the ontology for use with NLP tools. Ontologies that express topics in ways that rely on analysts’ implicit knowledge are not best suited for use with NLP tools. For one thing, the definitions of two distinct concepts in an ontology may include similar words if they relate to the same context, leaving concepts insufficiently disambiguated and unable to retrieve distinct passages in a corpus. Topic refinement is thus needed to increase the resolution of topics, rewording them to increase the semantic distance between topics and reduce the number of common sentences they match. Ontology enrichment is also needed to expand the conceptual scope of our ontology to capture evolving constitutional content and diverse conceptualizations in the constitutional domain.\nOur approach takes several steps to refine the CCP ontology for use with our NLP tools and to increase its topical scope. This will:\n\nRewrite CCP topics to improve differentiation between topics, discrimination in topic matches, and accuracy of topic matches.\nExamine global, regional, and domain-specific ontologies to identify topics that are not yet in the CCP ontology but are relevant to corpus CCP classifies (constitutions).\nPublish a new CCP ontology that integrates the topic refinements for NLP applications, concepts enriched by similar concepts in other ontologies, and relevant new concepts integrated from other ontologies.\n\nRefinement of the CCP ontology is a requisite step for our follow-on projects. Yet, it also allows us to answer several research questions related to ontology enrichment, namely: Which topic structures are most compatible with our NLP tools? How can we measure improved CCP topic separation and topic matching? How can ontology comparison improve ontology accuracy, completeness, and alignment across a domain?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Concepts are at the core of scientific inquiry. In some fields, systematizing and organizing concepts has been a central concern, and has even led to high levels of consensus on categories and labels. The Linnaean taxonomy in biology and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in Psychiatry are two well-known examples. In other fields, such as political science and law, concepts are less regulated.\nUncoordinated proliferation of conceptual frameworks in comparative law constrains systematic comparison and alignment of findings across studies, and in turn constrains the accumulation of knowledge. Fifty years ago, Giovanni Sartori and others—concerned about just such a “Tower of Babel” problem in political science—spearheaded a movement towards a more self-conscious use of concepts. Like Sartori, we recognize the personal and collective benefits of analyzing concepts and associating them with empirical phenomena. We also perceive an opportunity to use technology to advance this work.\nNatural language processing (NLP) can accelerate a more systematic approach to the representation of concepts in comparative law. We are developing concept-processing tools that measure the semantic similarity of sentence-level text segments, with no preprocessing of text. These allow us to analyze the large volumes of text generated from legal processes like constitutional design, public consultation, and court rulings—all critically important processes with products that have historically been too unwieldy to analyze in a broadly comparative way.\nOur digital tools facilitate the systematic comparison, integration, and application of concepts across comparative law. We seek to use them to improve constitutional design by organizing and enriching the historical and cross-national information available to constitution drafters and analysts. But they are applicable across the constitutional domain and beyond."
