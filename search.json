Most recently, the consultation process in Chile produced more than 2.4 million suggestions for constitutional content and nearly 265,000 more comments explaining these. The question guiding such consultations—“Which constitutional topics are of most interest to citizens?”—is intractable without an applicable ontology and a method for analyzing vast volumes of text.\nOur consultation project has developed tools to link constitutional content to public consultation input to assess the prevalence, evolution, and uptake of constitutional ideas raised by citizens. We are currently analyzing the world’s most recent and ambitious consultation effort in Chile. Detailed, systematic analysis of such voluminous public consultation input has been prohibitively complex to date, but our new tools make it possible.\nOur approach takes several steps to assess the constitutional topics raised in Chilean public consultations. This will:\nThis allows us to answer several research questions related to public consultations, namely: Which constitutional topics are raised most often in Chilean public consultations and drafting body deliberations? How do topics raised in Chile compare to those in constitutions globally? Do drafters leverage public input rhetorically or substantively in the drafting process? How does the design and timing of consultations shape constitutional text? How can we validate the accuracy of topic matching to consultation corpora?"

    "text": "Methods Paper\nAbstract: Public consultation has become an indispensable part of constitutional design, yet the voluminous, narrative data produced are often impractical to analyze. There are also few, if any, standards for such analysis. Using a comprehensive reference ontology from the Comparative Constitutions Project (CCP), we develop a new methodology to identify constitutional topics of most concern to citizens and compare these to topics in constitutions globally. To develop our approach, we analyze data from Chile’s 2016 public consultations—an ambitious process that produced nearly 265,000 narrative responses and launched the constitutional reform process that remains underway today. We leverage advances in natural language processing, in particular sentence-level semantic similarity technology, to classify consultation responses with respect to constitutional topics. Our methodology has major potential for advocates, drafters, and researchers seeking to analyze public consultation data that too often goes unexamined. Replication data for this paper are here."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A central focus of our prior work has been the collection and analysis of contemporary and historical constitutions, which we have organized as the Comparative Constitutions Project (CCP) (Elkins and Ginsburg 2021). Using the CCP ontology, we have identified a core set of 330 topics in each written constitution of independent countries from 1789 to the present. This spatial-temporal identification of constitutional elements has since facilitated at least 200 published analyses of the origins and consequences of these institutions. Yet, we do not see CCP as the authoritative ontology in this space. If anything, we see CCP as a preliminary reference set for the integration of other ontologies in comparative law.\nOur ontology enrichment project thus refines the CCP ontology to expand its conceptual scope and to optimize the ontology for use with NLP tools. Ontologies that express topics in ways that rely on analysts’ implicit knowledge are not best suited for use with NLP tools. For one thing, the definitions of two distinct concepts in an ontology may include similar words if they relate to the same context, leaving concepts insufficiently disambiguated and unable to retrieve distinct passages in a corpus. Topic refinement is thus needed to increase the resolution of topics, rewording them to increase the semantic distance between topics and reduce the number of common sentences they match. Ontology enrichment is also needed to expand the conceptual scope of our ontology to capture evolving constitutional content and diverse conceptualizations in the constitutional domain.\nOur approach takes several steps to refine the CCP ontology for use with our NLP tools and to increase its topical scope. This will:\n\nRewrite CCP topics to improve differentiation between topics, discrimination in topic matches, and accuracy of topic matches.\nExamine global, regional, and domain-specific ontologies to identify topics that are not yet in the CCP ontology but are relevant to corpus CCP classifies (constitutions).\nPublish a new CCP ontology that integrates the topic refinements for NLP applications, concepts enriched by similar concepts in other ontologies, and relevant new concepts integrated from other ontologies.\n\nRefinement of the CCP ontology is a requisite step for our follow-on projects. Yet, it also allows us to answer several research questions related to ontology enrichment, namely: Which topic structures are most compatible with our NLP tools? How can we measure improved CCP topic separation and topic matching? How can ontology comparison improve ontology accuracy, completeness, and alignment across a domain?"

Over the last 10 years, we have experimented with other NLP methods, but in our view, vector semantics shows the most promise.\nWe are using these tools to: (1) refine the Comparative Constitutions Project (CCP) ontology for use with NLP tools and integrate multiple conceptual frameworks from comparative law to provide broader topic coverage, (2) use the new CCP ontology to provide section-level topic coverage of national constitutions globally, (3) link constitutional content to public consultation input to assess the prevalence, evolution, and uptake of constitutional ideas raised by citizens, and (4) link constitutional content to court rulings to assess the prevalence, evolution, and extension of constitutional ideas brought to courts around the world."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Concepts are at the core of scientific inquiry. In some fields, systematizing and organizing concepts has been a central concern, and has even led to high levels of consensus on categories and labels. The Linnaean taxonomy in biology and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in Psychiatry are two well-known examples. In other fields, such as political science and law, concepts are less regulated.\nUncoordinated proliferation of conceptual frameworks in comparative law constrains systematic comparison and alignment of findings across studies, and in turn constrains the accumulation of knowledge. Fifty years ago, Giovanni Sartori and others—concerned about just such a “Tower of Babel” problem in political science—spearheaded a movement towards a more self-conscious use of concepts. Like Sartori, we recognize the personal and collective benefits of analyzing concepts and associating them with empirical phenomena. We also perceive an opportunity to use technology to advance this work.\nNatural language processing (NLP) can accelerate a more systematic approach to the representation of concepts in comparative law. We are developing concept-processing tools that measure the semantic similarity of sentence-level text segments, with no preprocessing of text. These allow us to analyze the large volumes of text generated from legal processes like constitutional design, public consultation, and court rulings—all critically important processes with products that have historically been too unwieldy to analyze in a broadly comparative way.\nOur digital tools facilitate the systematic comparison, integration, and application of concepts across comparative law. We seek to use them to improve constitutional design by organizing and enriching the historical and cross-national information available to constitution drafters and analysts. But they are applicable across the constitutional domain and beyond."

CCP’s current analysis of 330 features across constitutions is a robust start at systematic analysis of national constitutions, yet an expanded set of topics and tools will allow us to identify myriad additional topics. Human-based content analysis is time-consuming, costly, and (even with rigorous coding procedures) inherently subjective.
