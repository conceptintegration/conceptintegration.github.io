    "text": "Public consultation has become an indispensable part of constitutional design, yet the voluminous narrative data produced are notoriously difficult to analyze. Most recently, the consultation process in Chile produced more than 2.4 million suggestions for constitutional content and nearly 265,000 more comments explaining these. The question guiding such consultations‚Äî‚ÄúWhich constitutional topics are of most interest to citizens?‚Äù‚Äîis intractable without an applicable ontology and a method for analyzing vast volumes of text.\nOur consultation project has developed tools to link constitutional content to public consultation input to assess the prevalence, evolution, and uptake of constitutional ideas raised by citizens. We are currently analyzing the world‚Äôs most recent and ambitious consultation effort in Chile. Detailed, systematic analysis of such voluminous public consultation input has been prohibitively complex to date, but our new tools make it possible.\nOur approach takes several steps to assess the constitutional topics raised in Chilean public consultations. This will:\n\nUse our CCP ontology to automatically classify the topics raised in public consultation input.\nTrace the prevalence, evolution, and uptake of citizens‚Äô constitutional ideas across the Chilean constitutional reform process, including public consultations held before and during the constitutional drafting, deliberations in the drafting body, and the final constitutional text.\nCompare the prevalence of topics raised in Chilean public consultations to topics entrenched in the world‚Äôs constitutions.\n\nThis allows us to answer several research questions related to public consultations, namely: Which constitutional topics are raised most often in Chilean public consultations and drafting body deliberations? How do topics raised in Chile compare to those in constitutions globally? Do drafters leverage public input rhetorically or substantively in the drafting process? How does the design and timing of consultations shape constitutional text? How can we validate the accuracy of topic matching to consultation corpora?"

    "text": "Constitution drafters and researchers have long explored the origins and consequences of constitutional ideas‚Äîto learn why constitutions succeed and falter, when constitutional ideas gain traction, and how they shape people‚Äôs lives. Yet it is hard to analyze these questions across different countries and contexts without a coordinated approach to conceptualizing and identifying these ideas. CCP‚Äôs current analysis of 330 features across constitutions is a robust start at systematic analysis of national constitutions, yet an expanded set of topics and tools will allow us to identify myriad additional topics. Human-based content analysis is time-consuming, costly, and (even with rigorous coding procedures) inherently subjective. On the other hand, our NLP tools support automated content analysis that is more comprehensive, objective, and reproducible.\nOur constitutional project thus uses our new CCP ontology to conduct an expanded analysis of constitutions. The aim is to produce complete section-level topic coverage of national constitutions worldwide. This will identify topics in constitution sections that are not yet indexed by CCP and will identify even more topics in those sections already indexed by CCP.\nOur approach takes several steps to identify a comprehensive set of features in current constitutions. This will:\n\nUse the new CCP ontology to automatically classify the topic of each section of all national constitutions currently in force around the world.\nApply new and revised topic assignments to all current constitutions.\nPublish the new constitutional data on GitHub and on Constitute.\n\nThis allows us to answer several research questions related to constitutional analysis, including: What new topics and patterns are revealed in analyzing the full topical scope of the world‚Äôs constitutions? How can we measure improvements in new topic discovery in constitutions? How can we validate the reduction of constitutional content without a CCP topic and the accuracy of topic matching to constitutions?"
