title: "Ontology Repository"
---

This page is both a placeholder and an invitation. We are creating a public repository for ontologies in comparative law to collect ontologies in the field and provide a foundation for concept integration. Hosted here on GitHub, the repository will include published ontologies from publishers and cataloguers, ontologies from individual authors of datasets, and relevant corpora. 

The repository will be a resource for scholars to explore concepts related to their own topics, build new ontologies by combining topics on particular themes, and see how their topics relate to this projectâ€™s constitutional, consultation, and court corpora.

If you have data, ontologies, or corpora in comparative law that could be a good fit, please contact us. We look forward to talking with you and learning about your work!
