# Deployment 🚀

- The site is a [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) published to GitHub pages [using GitHub Actions](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#github-action).
- Any changes to the repository will be automatically rendered by GitHub. For example, you can use your browser to edit any plain-text .qmd file on GitHub and, after a couple of minutes, the book will reflect the changes. Check out the "Actions" tab of this repository to track the progress of automated rendering.
- For more substantive changes, you should [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the repository (using e.g., CLI, GitHub Desktop, or [GitKraken](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitkraken-client/open-clone-init/)). After making local changes to the folder, run `quarto preview` in your terminal to see how the website will look once rendered. Next, simply push any commits to this GitHub repository and GitHub actions will take care of the online rendering.
- Check out the Quarto [documentation on websites](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) to make changes to the page structure.
